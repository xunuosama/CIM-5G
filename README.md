# CIM-5G
This storage repository is designed to store the modules and datasets related to 5G signal path loss and prediction within the CIM system.

Our dataset is stored in the "data" folder. Among them, "Raw_data" represents the completely unprocessed original data, "Rase_station" data is a part of the base station information, and "Grid-Based_Feature-Engineered_data" represents the data that has been integrated into grids and finally used for XGBoost training.
